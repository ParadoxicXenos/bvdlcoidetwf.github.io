Hello People,

I was instructed to remove the prebuilt .exes, so I will provide the repositories I used to make them.

USE XENONRECOMP FROM THE BELOW ONE
Hedge-dev: https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp

USE XENONANALYSE FROM THE BELOW ONE
Nitch2024: https://github.com/Nitch2024/XenonRecomp

This one has worked better for me due to actually getting switch tables from the .xex file, unlike the original one

To get any exe file from the code you must use CMake and Visual Studio to build it (i will link the tutorial I used below for you!)


===================================================================================HOW TO GET THE .XEX file===================================================================================================
Step 1: Legally obtain a copy of FH1 (or non legally)
Step 2: Use XGD Tool to  get the .xex from your .iso
Step 3: Use XEX Tool to unencrypt the .xex file
Step 4: you are done now :)
