Hello People,

I was instructed to remove the prebuilt .exes so i will provide the repositories I used to make them.

USE XENONRECOMP FROM THE BELOW ONE
Hedge-dev: https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp

USE XENONANALYSE FROM THE BELOW ONE
Nitch2024: https://github.com/Nitch2024/XenonRecomp

This one has worked better for me due to actually getting switch tables from the .xex file, unlike the original one

To get any exe file from the code you must use CMake and visual studio to build it (i will link the tutorial i used below for you!
